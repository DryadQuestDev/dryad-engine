## Google Docs Tools for Faster Authoring

Dryad Engine comes with a ready‑to‑use **Dungeon Template** Google Doc that already has the helper script installed and ready to use.  
Simply **make a copy of that template** for your dungeon, and you’ll see extra menus like:

- **Content Tables** – quickly insert pre‑formatted blocks for rooms, encounters, interactions, events, and scenes.
- **Toolbar helpers** – buttons to scan your document for things like actions, flags, anchors, inventories, helping you keep large dungeons consistent.  
- **Quest helpers** – templates for quest titles, stages, and goals, so your quest logs line up with how the engine expects data.

Once you’ve copied the template, you build content mostly by **clicking menu items** instead of hand‑typing every tag.

## Copying and Preparing the Template Document

To start using the template for your own game:

1. Open the template Google Doc by following this link: **[Dungeon Template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Maa_Dd2G_unq7cRbE1NHPVtcbRigBpwR2kUdSRBL5Gw/edit?tab=t.0)**.  
2. In the menu, go to **File → Make a copy** to create your own editable copy.  
3. In your copy, insert a first room table via **Content Tables → Room**.  
4. The first time you do this, Google Docs will show an **“Authorization Required”** popup – click **OK**.

5. In the next screen, click **“Show advanced”** and then **“Go to Dryad Engine Tables”**.  
   - Google will warn that the app is “unsafe” because it’s not from the marketplace – this is expected for custom scripts.

6. Tick the **“Select all”** checkbox and click **Continue** to grant the script the permissions it needs.

After that, the table will be inserted, and you **won’t need to authorize again for this document**.  
From now on you can freely add rooms, encounters, events, and quest blocks using the custom menus in your copied template.

## Bonus: Sidebar Utilities for Keeping Content Consistent

The template also comes with small **utility tools** that can scan your document and show summaries in a sidebar.  
You can quickly see **which actions, flags, anchors, and inventories** you’ve used so far, helping you:

- **Avoid duplicates or typos** in important identifiers.  
- **Spot missing hooks** (e.g. a flag you set but never check).  
- **Keep large dungeons coherent** as they grow.

Use these helpers whenever your dungeon starts getting big – they’re there to save you from manual tracking in a huge wall of text.
