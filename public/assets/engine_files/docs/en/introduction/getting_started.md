## Getting Started

The fastest way to understand Dryad Engine is to **play** with it before you try to build anything.

### 1. Play the Tutorial Game

Dryad Engine comes with a **Tutorial** game that walks you through the core ideas:

- Moving through dungeons and scenes  
- Interacting with choices, quests, and dialogue  
- Seeing characters, inventories, and UI in action  

If you haven’t already, start by **playing the Tutorial from beginning to end**.  

### 2. Open the Tutorial in the Editor

Once you’ve played it, the next step is to **open the Tutorial game in the editor** and see how it’s put together:

- Browse characters, items, stats, abilities, dungeons, and quests as data.  
- Click through different tabs to see how everything connects.  
- Notice how much of the game is defined through **structured content**, not code.

You don’t have to understand every panel yet. The goal is just to see that the whole game lives in one place, and the editor understands it.

### 3. The Game Editor: Your Power House

The **Game Editor** is where you’ll spend most of your time:

- It manages **all of your game data** and how different systems connect.  
- You can create and tweak **stats, abilities, item slots, characters, dungeons, quests, and more** without writing code.  
- As your project grows, the editor keeps your content organized so you don’t get lost.

It’s completely possible to build a **fully playable game** by staying inside the editor the whole time.

### 4. Optional: Where Else You Might Work

While the editor can take you very far on its own, there are a few optional “extra power” tools you might want to use during development:

- **Google Docs (strongly recommended for story‑heavy games)**  
  - Great for writing and reviewing long scenes, dialogue, and branching storylines.  
  - You draft and iterate in Google Docs, then import the content into your game with a click of a button.

- **Code editor (for advanced use cases)**  
  - Used for writing **custom JavaScript logic and CSS** when you want to go beyond what the editor offers out of the box.  
  - Ideal for special mechanics, unique UI widgets, or one‑off behaviors that are specific to your game.

- **Community plugins**  
  - Look for **community‑made plugins and content packs** to add or change data, logic, or UI without reinventing the wheel.  
  - Dryad Engine is designed like **Lego bricks** – you can snap in new pieces, remove them, or mix and match them to create exactly the game you want.

Most devs will:

- Do **structure and systems** work in the **Editor**,  
- Do **writing** in **Google Docs**,  
- And only touch the **code editor** when there's no plugins for it and they want to add a truly unique mechanic.
